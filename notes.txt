Monday
- welcome
q - how far back can we use ->None
- we will be installing additional packages as needed
> constructor pattern
> ABC
> conventions
  - as will all languages, identifiers can use letters, numbers and underscore (don't start with a number)
  - by convention, ClassesUsePascalCase, MethodsUseCaleCase identifiers_use_snake_case
> design patterns (and anti-patterns)
> decorator pattern (using @)
> factory and facade patterns
> command pattern
> after lunch review exercise
> immediate Python
> proxy pattern
> observables and subscribers (this is very fashionable just now)
- we will need Jupyter Notebooks later in the week

Tuesday
> summary of design patterns
> functional design
> state pattern
> RxPY https://rxpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
       https://rxmarbles.com/
- concurrency and parallel code
> the GIL
  see https://realpython.com/python-gil/
> thread functions and thread classes
> how to access the course recordings usr: neueda pwd: c0nygre
- thread locks/rlocks/semaphores
- semaphore quantity
- demonstrate the 'with' operator in other contexts...
- after lunch review exercise
- daemon threads
- ansyc/await and asyncio

Wednesday
- custom thread decorator to make classes and methods thread safe
- multiprocessing
- performance and timing
- profiling with @profile and cProfile
- after lunch review exercise
- why use a thread or a process
- generators
- prepare for Thursday

Thursday
- options for Jupyter Notebooks:
  - use Anaconda
  - pip install notebook
  - just use existing VSCode (or similar)
  - use cloud
- Python for Data Analysis
  we will need:
  - jupyter notebooks
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
	The easiest way to get all the bits and bobs is to use Anaconda
  Data sources (csv, xlsx, text, db, url...)
- using Jupyter notebooks
   you can 'pip install jupyter' then start it with 'python -m notebook'
   then you will also need to pip install numpy, pandas etc.
- numpy and data structures: the arange and array 
- pandas: series and data-frame
  NaN, creating stuctures, analysis (stats)
- data vizualisation with matplotlib
- data cleansing and preparation
- descriptive statistics
- handling files and remote data
- after lunch review exercise
- careful: exporting a notebook does not add 'print' statements

Friday
- statistical analysis and correlation
  REMEMBER: correlation does NOT prove CAUSATION
- review of microservices (inc. multi threading)
- Flask: running as dev or prod server (performance and security)
  to run as a debug server: flask --app my_flask.py --debug run
  or else debug=True in the app declaration
  see https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/
- after lunch review exercise
- end of course feedback
