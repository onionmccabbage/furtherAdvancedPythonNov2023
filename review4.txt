Review 4 (Data analysis) (1hr work until 3:00 then tea break until 3:15 then carry on to 3:45)
========================
- read in external data (data/flights.csv) into a data frame
- show the description
- show the dtypes
- find the mean flight time
‐ Group the data into separate data frames for each airline (pick a few)
In the flights data set, find:
‐ Show the minimum and mean departure delay for your chosen airlines (or all)
‐ The number of flight records
‐ The number of unique airlines
‐ How many unique aircraft are represented (tail number)
‐ The greatest recorded delay (show the related data)
‐ The mean values for just the first 50 records in the dataset, 
  then for all delays of 15 or more units

Optional: Consider how you can address the following challenges:
‐ On average, which airline is the most punctual
‐ Which airline arrives ahead of time most often
‐ Does flight duration appear to affect arrival punctuality more for some airlines than others
‐ Does time of day appear to affect departure punctuality across all flights
‐ Are the standard deviations of flight duration close to the standard deviations of flight distance
