Beyond Advanced Python Review Exercise 1
========================================

Individually or in groups, tackle as many of these challenges as you like, in any order
There will be a chance to show your thinking after the exercise

At the end please 'show and tell'

Decorator Pattern
- Write a decorator function that ensures all positional arguments are non-empty string
- expand this for other kinds of validation (eg int, float, numeric, instance-of)
- also validate keyword args

Facade and Factory patterns
- re-write the creature factory as a facade to all the creatures
- consider if the 'Manager' facade could be sensibly implemented as a factory

Command Pattern
- A stock can be 'shorted' (as well as buy/sell). Implement the basics of a 'short' command
- You could add a random feature for how much profit/loss a short stock makes

Or just play with design patterns to implement your own ideas
